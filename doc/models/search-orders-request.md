## Search Orders Request

The request does not have any required fields. When given no query criteria,
SearchOrders will return all results for all of the merchantâ€™s locations. When fetching additional
pages using a `cursor`, the `query` must be equal to the `query` used to fetch the first page of
results.

### Structure

`SearchOrdersRequest`

### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `location_ids` | `Array<String>` | Optional | The location IDs for the orders to query. The caller must have access to<br>all provided locations. Leave unset to search all locations that the caller has access to. |
| `cursor` | `String` | Optional | A pagination cursor returned by a previous call to this endpoint.<br>Provide this to retrieve the next set of results for your original query.<br>See [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/basics/api101/pagination) for more information. |
| `query` | [`Search Orders Query Hash`](/doc/models/search-orders-query.md) | Optional | Contains query criteria for the search. |
| `limit` | `Integer` | Optional | Number of results to be returned in a single page. SearchOrders may<br>use a smaller limit than specified depending on server load. If the response<br>includes a `cursor` field, you can use it to retrieve the next set of results.<br>Default: `500` |
| `return_entries` | `Boolean` | Optional | If set to `true`, SearchOrders will return [`OrderEntry`](#type-orderentry)<br>objects instead of `Order` objects. `OrderEntry` objects are lightweight<br>descriptions of orders that include `order_id`s.<br><br>Default: `false`. |
