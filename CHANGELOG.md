# Change Log

## Version 5.0.0.20200226 (2020-02-26)
## API releases
* **GA release**: All SDKs have been updated to support the new Bank Accounts and CashDrawerShifts APIs.

* **Beta release**: All SDKs have been updated to support the new Disputes API.


## Existing API updates

All SDKs have been updated to support the following changes:

* **Catalog API**    
  * Batch upsert catalog objects endpoint &mdash; The `batches` field is now required and the array must have at least one element.   
  * CatalogModifier &mdash; Two fields added:
     * `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a modifier list   
     * `modifier_list_id` to reference the parent modifier list
  * CatalogModifierList &mdash; New field added: `ordinal` to support custom ordering in a list of **CatalogModifierList** objects.

* **Customers API changes**
  * SearchCustomers endpoint &mdash; `limit` size reduced from 1000 to 100 to improve the endpoint performance. 

* **Orders API changes**
  * CreateOrderRequest &mdash; Previously these request fields were deprecated: `line_items`, `taxes`, `discounts`. These fields are no longer available. Instead you now use the `Order` object in the request. For example, `Order.line_items`, `Order.taxes`, and `Order.discounts`.
  * OrderLineItem type &mdash; There are two changes:
    * The `taxes` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_taxes` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemTax.scope` field. 
    * The `discounts` field that was previously deprecated is no longer available. Instead, you now use the `OrderLineItem.applied_discounts` field. This also now requires that you set the `OrderLineItemDiscount.scope` field. 

* **Shared object updates**
  * **Card object** &mdash; New fields added: `card_type`, `prepaid_type`. Currently, only the Payments API responses populate these fields. 
  
## Version 4.1.0.20200122 (2020-01-22)

* New field:  The **Employee** object now has an `is_owner` field.
* New enumeration:  The **CardBrand** enumeration has a new `SQUARE_CAPITAL_CARD` enum value to support a Square one-time Installments payment.

* New request body field constraint: The __Refund__ Payment request now requires a payment_id. 

## Version 4.0.0-20191217 (2019-12-17)

Square is excited to announce the public release of customized SDKs for [Java](https://github.com/square/square-java-sdk) and [.NET](https://github.com/square/square-dotnet-sdk). For more information, see [Square SDKs](/sdks).

* Square now follows the semantic versioning scheme for all SDKs except PHP and Node.js. This versioning scheme uses three numbers to delineate MAJOR, MINOR, and PATCH versions of our SDK. In addition, the SDK version also includes the API version so you know what Square API version the SDK is related to. For more information, see [Versioning and SDKs](build-basics/versioning-overview#versioning-and-sdks).
* Java, .Net, Python, and Ruby SDKs are now version 4.0.0. Java and .Net SDKs have breaking changes in version 4.0.0. Ruby and Python do not have breaking changes.
