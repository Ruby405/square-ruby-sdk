### Fields

| Name | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | `String` | Optional | A unique ID generated by Square for the<br>`InventoryTransfer`. |
| `reference_id` | `String` | Optional | An optional ID provided by the application to tie the<br>`InventoryTransfer` to an external system. |
| `state` | [`String (Inventory State)`](/doc/models/inventory-state.md) | Optional | Indicates the state of a tracked item quantity in the lifecycle of goods. |
| `from_location_id` | `String` | Optional | The Square ID of the [Location](#type-location) where the related<br>quantity of items were tracked before the transfer. |
| `to_location_id` | `String` | Optional | The Square ID of the [Location](#type-location) where the related<br>quantity of items were tracked after the transfer. |
| `catalog_object_id` | `String` | Optional | The Square generated ID of the<br>`CatalogObject` being tracked. |
| `catalog_object_type` | `String` | Optional | The `CatalogObjectType` of the<br>`CatalogObject` being tracked.Tracking is only<br>supported for the `ITEM_VARIATION` type. |
| `quantity` | `String` | Optional | The number of items affected by the transfer as a decimal string.<br>Can support up to 5 digits after the decimal point.<br><br>_Important_: The Point of Sale app and Dashboard do not currently support<br>decimal quantities. If a Point of Sale app or Dashboard attempts to read a<br>decimal quantity on inventory counts or adjustments, the quantity will be rounded<br>down to the nearest integer. For example, `2.5` will become `2`, and `-2.5`<br>will become `-3`.<br>Read [Decimal Quantities (BETA)](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/docs/inventory-api/what-it-does#decimal-quantities-beta) for more information. |
| `occurred_at` | `String` | Optional | A client-generated timestamp in RFC 3339 format that indicates when<br>the transfer took place. For write actions, the `occurred_at` timestamp<br>cannot be older than 24 hours or in the future relative to the time of the<br>request. |
| `created_at` | `String` | Optional | A read-only timestamp in RFC 3339 format that indicates when Square<br>received the transfer request. |
| `source` | [`Source Application Hash`](/doc/models/source-application.md) | Optional | Provides information about the application used to generate an inventory<br>change. |
| `employee_id` | `String` | Optional | The Square ID of the [Employee](#type-employee) responsible for the<br>inventory transfer. |
