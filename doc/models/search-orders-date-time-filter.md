## Search Orders Date Time Filter

Filter for `Order` objects based on whether their `CREATED_AT`,
`CLOSED_AT` or `UPDATED_AT` timestamps fall within a specified time range.
You can specify the time range and which timestamp to filter for. You can filter
for only one time range at a time.

For each time range, the start time and end time are inclusive. If the end time
is absent, it defaults to the time of the first request for the cursor.

__Important:__ If you use the DateTimeFilter to filter for `CLOSED_AT` or `UPDATED_AT`,
you must also set the [OrdersSort](./models/orders-sort.md).
The TimeRange used in DateTimeFilter must correspond to the `sort_field` in
the [OrdersSort](./models/orders-sort.md) object.
