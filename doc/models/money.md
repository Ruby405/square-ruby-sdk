## Money

Represents an amount of money.

__Important:__ Unlike version 1 of the Connect API, __all monetary amounts
returned by v2 endpoints are positive.__ (In v1, monetary amounts are negative
if they represent money being paid _by_ a merchant, instead of money being
paid _to_ a merchant.)
