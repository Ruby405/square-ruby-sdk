## Order Line Item Applied Tax

Represents an applied portion of a tax to a line item in an order.

Order scoped taxes will automatically have applied taxes present for each line item.
Line item scoped taxes must have applied taxes added manually for any applicable line items.
The corresponding applied money will automatically be computed based on participating line
items.
