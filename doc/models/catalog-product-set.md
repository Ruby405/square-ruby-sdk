## Catalog Product Set

Represents a collection of catalog objects for the purpose of applying a
[PricingRule](#type-pricingrule). Including a catalog object will include all of
its subtypes. For example, including a category in a product set will include
all of its items and associated item variations in the product set. Including
an item in a product set will also include its item variations.
